you enter the mysterious room. no one else is there, just you...and a big blank screen.

you had been given instructions to go into the room on your first day at the new company, MODHAUS.

"what is this place..." you wonder.

just a week ago, this mysterious company had offered you a job. "we have found recently that you have amazing potential," the letter they sent you said, "you have special abilities that no one else has, and that you do not know you possess."

you had been studying to retake the suneung. but of course, desperate to escape your mundane school life, you decided to leave and join this shady company instead.

"i mean. what's the worst that could happen?"

suddenly, the screen lights up.

*yoon seoyeon, you have chosen to become the first big S, or S1. out of many small s in the world, you are the first girl we discovered with the special ability to make S, a special kind of energy with supernatural properties.* 

*you have been equipped with 2 S. these 2 S are very valuable and rare, but they will no longer be rare when we start mass producing them.*

*your job now is to generate as much S as possible. click the 'S1' button to spend 2 S to buy your first dimension.*

and that is how you begin producing massive amounts of a mysterious substance you know almost nothing about just to pay the bills.
  `,
  `
apprehensively, you press the little button labeled "S1". suddenly, a machine appears in front of you.

*each S1 dimension allows you to produce 0.001 S per millisecond. this number may increase over time, but what's important now is that you get as many dimensions as possible to produce S.*

*when you have 4 S, you will be able to introduce another big S into the room. the second big S (S2) will not generate S, but is equipped with a dimension that generates your dimensions.*

*each subsequent big S generates dimensions of the previous big S. for example, S3 dimensions will generate S2 dimensions, which in turn generate S1 dimensions, which generate S. this allows your S production to increase exponentially.*

*additionally, for every dimension you buy, you increase the production by 1/24 (exponentially).*

*you must unlock and buy each S in order. for example, S3 cannot be bought unless you have at least one S2 dimension.*

*keep generating S until you are able to unlock more members.*
  `,
  `
you press the "S2" button. suddenly, another girl comes in and sits down next to you. the screen then lights up again.

*jeong hyerin, you have been chosen to become the second big S, or S2. out of many small s in the world, you are the second girl we discovered with the special ability to make S.*

*your job now is to generate as many S1 dimensions as possible. with yoon seoyeon, or S1, you will soon unlock 6 other S.*

*i will see you then.*

"b-but," she stutters, "who are you? and why are we here? how did you find us?"

*my name is SUAH. we at MODHAUS searched far and wide through years and years of extensive research to find 24 special girls who have the special ability. you two are just the first two.*

*your purpose will soon be made clear.*

and with that, the screen goes blank again.
  `,
  `
after minutes... or was it hours? you have no idea. you've lost track of time at this point.

anyway, after a bunch of grinding, you finally have nearly enough S to introduce S8 into the room, which the 7 of you have affectionately nicknamed the HAUS, despite it being a "room" and not a "house". 

at this point, five other members have been revealed. 
S3 lee jiwoo,
S4 kim chaeyeon,
S5 kim yooyeon,
S6 kim soomin,
and S7 kim nakyoung.

the 7 of you have been hard at work, and have produced a lot of S in a rather short amount of time.

"what's... e19?" soomin inquires.

"oh its just ten quintillion," yooyeon quickly answers, "nothing much."

"look!" hyerin points excitedly to the screen, "we have enough to bring in S8!"

"here goes nothing!" you quickly press the "S8" button, and the eighth girl finally walks in.

"hi...uh..." S8 walks in and waves shyly. "my name's gong yubin. do you guys know why we're here?"

"don't worry too much about that yet. SUAH will be coming in any minute..." hyerin mutters.

"SUAH? who's SUAH?" jiwoo asks.

"you'll see." you sit the last girl down in front of the screen as it lights up once again.

*greetings, seoyeon and hyerin. i see you have gathered the next 6 girls. good job.*

*to the other 6 of you, welcome. my name is SUAH, and i am an AI representative of MODHAUS, the secret organisation that has brought you all here.*

*as i told seoyeon and hyerin earlier, we at MODHAUS searched far and wide through years and years of extensive research to find the 24 special girls who have the special ability to produce S.*

*at the moment, we have only found the 8 of you, although many more are on the way.*

*right now, your task is to get to 1.333e33 S. such huge amounts of S are at the very limit of our capacity, so the S will combust and cause what is called a grand gravity, your first prestige layer. *

*i will see you then.

"'prestige layer'...? this sounds like an idle game," chaeyeon remarks.

"that's because it is." nakyoung deadpans.

"is no one going to talk about how she said that the S will combust?" yubin's face is filled with worry.

"we need to get out of here ASAP!" hyerin darts a few hurried glances around the room, looking for an exit.

"do any of you have matches? we might be able to burn the place down." jiwoo shouts.

"I HAVE A BOX!" yooyeon tosses her box of matches over.

"I WANT TO GO HOME!" soomin screams.

"GUYS. CALM DOWN. WE'RE GOING TO LIVE. THEY PROBABLY WON'T KILL US HERE," you shout to calm everyone down. 

"are you sure?" soomin looks scared.

"yes. yes. no one is dying here. not under my watch."

everyone takes in deep breaths to calm themselves down. jiwoo quickly puts her matches away.

"ALRIGHT!" you clasp your hands together, struggling to keep her own cool. 

"we need to stay here and finish all of this so we can get out. we're going to have to trust SUAH and MODHAUS on this one. now everyone get back to work!"
    `,
  `
the smoke clears. the 8 of you emerge coughing, while the screen lights up again.

*congratulations on your first grand gravity. you have now unlocked multiple different things to boost your S production.

chaeyeon grimaces. "there's more...?"

*yes. after all, we still do not have all 24 girls yet.*

*anyway, back to the new things you've unlocked with the first grand gravity.*

*first thing you've unlocked is como. como will be used for another set of dimensions, and como progression will be much slower. these como dimensions will generate como power, which will boost your S production. you will also get (como power)^(1/24) como per second.*

*the second thing you've unlocked are objekts. the first 8 objekts unlock autobuyers for each of your dimensions so that your work will be less manual. the other 64 autobuyers boost the speed of the respective S's autobuyer.*

*the third thing you've unlocked is grand gravity challenges. finishing the first grand gravity was actually your first challenge, and you have completed it! the other 7 challenges boost your production, and to complete these, you will have to generate enough como for a grand gravity under harsh conditions. rewards for challenges also consist of one objekt and one como, of course.*

*your new task is to get all 72 objekts and finish all 8 challenges. i will see you again then. but before i leave...*

a drawer pops out of the wall.

*here is two como and one objekt. with every grand gravity, you will be given one set of these, but your como doubles every grand gravity.*

the objekt is a very smooth laminated piece of paper with a picture of one of you on it, and feels like a trading card but slightly thicker. the como, meanwhile, are a bunch of shiny purple tokens.

"interesting..." you muse. "so we need to do another...71 grand gravities before suah meets us again! EVERYBODY BACK TO WORK!"
  `,
  `
you finally have 72 objekts. the big screen lights up again, and everyone turns to the bright light emitting from it.

*sighs* unfortunately, we have hit a wall.

"what?" yubin asks, "what do you mean, *a wall*?"

*unfortunately, the CEO has not allowed you to proceed. this is the end of the road for now.*

*they will soon build the road ahead for you to proceed, but for now, all you can do is keep grinding for como.*

"i dont like this guy," soomin pouts.

"shush," jiwoo shushes soomin, "they might fire you."

*regardless of your opinions, i will see you soon.

and with that, the screen goes blank.

*thank you for playing the beta version of generation.SSS.*
